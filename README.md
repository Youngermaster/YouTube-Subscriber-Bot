# YouTube-Subscriber-Bot `[DEPRECATED]`

The idea is to create a bot that subscribes to a given channel automatically

## How to execute it?

I recomend to use *Python virtual environments*.

```shell
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate
pip intall -r requirements.txt
python youtube_subscriber.py
```

## What I meant by `[DEPRECATED]`?

It means that I won't longer support this project, this due that the project didn't work fully,
the project project works fine sometimes, but sometimes it crashes.

So, if someone can use it as a base for future projects, or it's capable to make the project work
100% fine, well... Go ahead, I will be willing to learn how you did it.
